# 🏙️ Project 1: Airbnb NYC Data Cleaning & EDA

This project focuses on exploring and cleaning the [Airbnb NYC 2019 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data). The goal is to prepare the dataset for downstream analytics and reporting by applying basic data cleaning and visualization techniques.

## Objectives

- Load and inspect the raw Airbnb NYC dataset
- Handle missing values and drop irrelevant columns
- Generate basic insights and summary statistics
- Visualize trends using `matplotlib` and `pandas`

## Dataset

- Source: [Kaggle – Airbnb NYC 2019](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data)
- Records: ~49,000
- Features: Listings, hosts, prices, reviews, geolocation, etc.

---

## Data Cleaning Steps

- Removed columns: `id`, `host_name`
- Filled null values in `reviews_per_month` with `0`
- Exported cleaned CSV for reuse

---

## Key Visualizations

1. **Average Price by Borough**  
   Compare the average price per listing across different NYC boroughs.

2. **Top 10 Neighborhoods by Number of Listings**  
   See which neighborhoods are the most popular in terms of listings.

3. **Price Distribution (under $500)**  
   Understand the pricing trend by removing outliers.

4. **Room Type Distribution**  
   Visual representation of shared vs private vs entire home listings.

## Next Steps

- Build a PySpark version of the same pipeline
- Extend this into a data pipeline: raw data → clean → store as Parquet → load to Snowflake
- Add a Streamlit dashboard or Tableau view
